Xavier and I have been given the opportunity to study computer science at FFHS while gaining practical knowledge, working @Amanox Solutions AG. We are employed as trainees and enrolled in school as practice-integrated Bachelor students (PiBS). This programm is mainly addressed to high school graduates, but we made it as vocational baccalaureates with the passing of an additional module in Maths.

**Our big day**: After a warm welcoming on 08-02-2021 at 10 am, we were given some gifts at first. With headset, water bottle and backpack, we new PiBS-students have been spoiled and accepted into the Amanoxian team. The best thing: Our own ergonomic workstations with top equipment. After the greetings, we went into the modern meetingroom together with the PiBS-coaches and made an introduction round. 

We were invited to eat lunch around the corner at "La Carbonara" and got to know eachother even better.

Afterwards, we were instructed by Fabian on how to set up the PC and install some first programs via PowerShell and chocolatey. It had already been announced that the afternoon agenda would be a surprise. We then set off with the rides to the city centre. 

The joy was big when we stood in front of the Adventure Room in Bern. In the basement we slipped into the role of Indiana Jones and searched for an archaelogist friend who had disappeared in search of the Holy Grail. The two teams, divided into Enterprise Cloud and Public Cloud, while competing against each other in a duel. There was a glorious victory for the Public Cloud team, which beat their opponents hands down with a score of 2:0. After a fotoshoot the first work day ended.

It was a great pleasure getting such a nice start in the new chapter.

Further on "real business" started. We got introduced to our first task: to build our trainee diary, which you are visiting right now. Working through Fabian's guid, we learned step by step on how to create our website using Github and Netlify. To adjust the website content we use Visual Studio Code and push the changes. This was my main task for the week. I learned how to use commands on powershell like:

```
cd . (enters or leaves path)
```
```
ls . (list) 
```
```
git pull (enables pushing)
```
```
git add --all
git commit -m "grow blog"
git push
(pushes the modifications)
```

Sometimes i struggled pushing the modifications and couldn't find out why by my self. So gladly, Fabian and Rafael where there to help me out in stagnant situations.

For Melanie, who works in marketing, i wrote the blog about our first day at Amanox and made an account on linkedin. Rafael, new Amanoxian, Xavier and I also had an additional business introduction from Martin. He showed us our organisational chart and explained what Amanox specialises in.

Later on we decided how our work schedule would look like. My official school day is every Monday. Tuesday would be the variable self-study day. Meaning if a coach issues a module on a tuesday, I switch the self-study day.

It was fun to learn so many new things and getting a tiny glims into the depths of Computer Science. I really enjoy being in the office and working on my trainee diary while fumbling my way in.
