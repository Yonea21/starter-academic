Xavier and I have been given the opportunity to study computer science at FFHS while gaining practical knowledge, working @Amanox Solutions AG. We are employed as Trainees and enrolled in school as practice-integrated Bachelor students (PiBS). This programm is mainly addressed to high school graduates, but we made it as vocational baccalaureates with the passing of an additional module in Maths.

Our big day: After a warm welcoming on 08-02-2021 at 10 am, we were given some gifts at first. With headset, water bottle and backpack, we new PiBS-students have been spoiled and accepted into the Amanoxian team. The best thing: Our own ergonomic workstations with top equipment. After the greetings, we went into the modern meetingroom together with the PiBS-coaches and made an introduction round. 

We were invited to eat lunch around the corner at "La Carbonara" and got to know eachother even better.



uckly I was given the opportunity to get some highquality education!
