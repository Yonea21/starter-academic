I hope you enjoy reading my journals.

======================

I had to make sure to start with Jim's module [Hardware Basics](https://yonea-koch.netlify.app/project/hardware-basics/). From then on I was growing my trainee diary while learning the hardware basics provided by one of my coaches Jim. I began to understand how to add Posts and Projects on my Blog. I also got some first feedbakcs from Luca, who highlighted some errors, braught suggestions for improvement and send me the [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#code). I quickly realised that I could get lost in time easily trying all the different formattings. My priority was to continue the tasks in the initiated module. I got to find out what kind of components my PC at work is made of. Learning the difference between bits and bytes as well as exploring the binary number system was quite interesting. Some tutorials on YouTube accentuatet the complex production of Chips for CPUs, which i felt like it opened my range of perspective. I'm just about starting the Johnny Simulator and still figuring out what it is that I need to do. When I've figured out how to complete this task, I will continue with `Boolean algebra`. This week we would've assembled and dissembled a PC/server but we had to postpone this assignment due vacations.

Dan, our boss, showed Xavier and me the building and what places we can use in this facility. There's a super nice roof terrace for grabbing some fresh air if needed. If you want to do some activities to strenghten Team bonding, go downstairs in the cellar and play pingpong or soccer box game. When you're having a hard time you can visit our quiet room and take a powernap. There's also a lunchroom for use, when you want to heat up your leftovers.

The studyprogramm I'm enrolled in, requiers its students to prepare themselves in advance. I used this week to do the reading tasks and preparations for the modules. In the beginning phase I find it quite difficult to understand everything from the start. Let's see how well I'll adapt.

======================

I started this week with my first day @FFHS. The location is incredible. In general I'm pleasantly surprised. Foremost i learned how important it is to prepare myself in advance. Studying at home became my top priority. The classroom events exist mainly to clarify uncertainties on site. I appreciate the well build structure of the modules and how they focus on the essential contents. Tuesday I spent with the post-processing of mondays modules. *For every module there are three phases:*  

```
Pre-processing
Classroom event
Post-processing
```

*Each phase is crucial for fully understanding the following modules:*  

```
Project Management
Java Fundamentals
Discrete Mathematics
Web Fundamentals
Fundamentals of Computer Engineering
Linear Algebra
```

Working through Jim's module was very usefull. In school we also treat hardware basics. That's how I can adapt the things I learned in practice directly on to the tasks in school. The only thing left to do is to prepare my powerpoint presentation. Fifteen minutes I'll talk about more than just basic hardware knowledge.

====================

Second day at school and two more subjects to take through. I descovered my new favorite module of all: Web Fundamentals. Who would have thought? I enjoy combining technology with design the most. I am learning right know how to create my own HTML site. It really takes time tough. I'd be lost without cheatsheets or the internet. We got a task due 5th of september, in which I create together with my classmate Laura a website for a pizza place. This is actually fun.
On Tuesday I met another classmate of mine, Oliver, with whom I studied math. We grabed lunch from Mishio and discovered the beautiful sites of Bern.

Tuesday evening, back home, I even helped a friend in maths. I showed my friend how to simplify logarithms. There really lies my strength and I'm glad if I can pass on my knowledge and tricks. 

Wednesday, back in the office, I worked on my trainee diary and started preparing for my PowerPoint presentation about Liquid Metal as TIM.

Thursday: I got on with my presentation when I realised that I chose a very complex topic. Quickly I decided to change my subject. Talking about GPUs makes me feel definitly more comfortable, as a gamer myself. Since I was a little girl I dreamed about buying my Nvidia GeForce 4GB for optimal gaming experience. Know, some years later, technology advanced and you get better quality for lower prices. But my goal still is to build my owm gaming setup with a highquality GPU and some fancy LED decorated fans. Once I'll have time to game for hours again...
