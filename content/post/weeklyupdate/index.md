> On this Blogpage I document weekly updates regarding my work progress. Mostly i write about things that I learned, where I failed or succeeded and reflect my overall experiences.

I hope you enjoy reading my journals.

08/11/21 - 08/13/21
======================

I had to make sure to start with Jim's module [Hardware Basics](https://yonea-koch.netlify.app/project/hardware-basics/). From then on I was growing my trainee diary while learning the hardware basics provided by one of my coaches Jim. I began to understand how to add Posts and Projects on my Blog. I also got some first feedbakcs from Luca, who highlighted some errors, braught suggestions for improvement and send me the [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#code). I quickly realised that I could get lost in time easily trying all the different formattings. My priority was to continue the tasks in the initiated module. I got to find out what kind of components my PC at work is made of. Learning the difference between bits and bytes as well as exploring the binary number system was quite interesting. Some tutorials on YouTube accentuatet the complex production of Chips for CPUs, which i felt like it opened my range of perspective. I'm just about starting the Johnny Simulator and still figuring out what it is that I need to do. When I've figured out how to complete this task, I will continue with `Boolean algebra`. This week we would've assembled and dissembled a PC/server but we had to postpone this assignment due vacations.

Dan, our boss, showed Xavier and me the building and what places we can use in this facility. There's a super nice roof terrace for grabbing some fresh air if needed. If you want to do some activities to strenghten Team bonding, go downstairs in the cellar and play pingpong or soccer box game. When you're having a hard time you can visit our quiet room and take a powernap. There's also a lunchroom for use, when you want to heat up your leftovers.

The studyprogramm I'm enrolled in, requiers its students to prepare themselves in advance. I used this week to do the reading tasks and preparations for the modules. In the beginning phase I find it quite difficult to understand everything from the start. Let's see how well I'll adapt.

======================

I started this week with my first day @FFHS. The location is incredible. In general I'm pleasantly surprised. Foremost i learned how important it is to prepare myself in advance. Studying at home became my top priority. The classroom events exist mainly to clarify uncertainties on site. I appreciate the well build structure of the modules and how they focus on the essential contents. Tuesday I spent with the post-processing of mondays modules. *For every module there are three phases:*  

```
Pre-processing
Classroom event
Post-processing
```

*Each phase is crucial for fully understanding the following modules:*  

```
Project Management
Java Fundamentals
Discrete Mathematics
Web Fundamentals
Basics of technical informatics
Linear Algebra
```

Working through Jim's module was very usefull. In school we also treat hardware basics. That's how I can adapt the things I learned in practice directly on to the tasks in school. The only thing left to do is to prepare my powerpoint presentation. Fifteen minutes I'll talk about more than just basic hardware knowledge.

====================

Second day at school and two more subjects to take through. I descovered my new favorite module of all: Web Fundamentals. Who would have thought? I enjoy combining technology with design the most. I am learning right know how to create my own HTML site. It really takes time tough. I'd be lost without cheatsheets or the internet. We got a task due 5th of september, in which I create together with my classmate Laura a website for a pizza place. This is actually fun.
On Tuesday I met another classmate of mine, Oliver, with whom I studied math. We grabed lunch from Mishio and discovered the beautiful sites of Bern.

Tuesday evening, back home, I even helped a friend in maths. I showed my friend how to simplify logarithms. There really lies my strength and I'm glad if I can pass on my knowledge and tricks. 

Wednesday, back in the office, I worked on my trainee diary and started preparing for my PowerPoint presentation about Liquid Metal as TIM.

Thursday: I got on with my presentation when I realised that I chose a very complex topic. Quickly I decided to change my subject. Talking about GPUs makes me feel definitly more comfortable, as a gamer myself. Since I was a little girl I dreamed about buying my Nvidia GeForce 4GB for optimal gaming experience. Know, some years later, technology advanced and you get better quality for lower prices. But my goal still is to build my owm gaming setup with a highquality GPU and some fancy LED decorated fans. Once I'll have time to game for hours again...

On friday we had our teammeeting. Xavier and I had to tell about our first three weeks @Amanox. I could have expressed myself way better. That is something that I want to work on. When it's my turn to speak I get stressed pretty easily and tend to speak indistinctly. The first step is to stay calm and take the time. It's allowed to make pauses between the senctences. Later on I held a presentation about the GPU. After John's constructive feedback, I know how to improve my presentation skills.

09/01/21 - 09/03/21
=====================
School, School, School! I learned that having six modules is pretty tough. I stay positiv and make the best out of my days. Right now I'm creating a website for a pizzeria on the basis of GitHub and Webstorm. It's due to next monday. We also have a huge assignment in `basics of technical informatcis` due then. It's about understanding the Johnny Simulator, following through related tasks and record the steps in a documentation.

Together with Dominik we created several offers. After the exchange of requirements for PC's and servers we created offers for the module. Subsequently Xavier and I had the opportunity to call Omero. He expalined us the whole process regarding offers and orders for customers. 

<br>

09/08/21 - 09/10/21
====================
We began working on the module 2. Python. I realized that learning the basics takes its time. Another challenge is to not confuse Python with the similar programming language Java. (We currently learn Java in school.) Python is a so called dynamic programming language and is simpler in syntax in contrast to java.

09/15/21 - 09/17/21
======================
On wednseday we had a Briefing with Melanie to get an overview about the upcoming DotNext event. Xavier and I became responsible for its organisation. On top of that we also got the responsibility for Emma. She is a 14 year old girl that wants to get to know Amanox. From her school she got the task to find a company that shows her around and introduces her to her dreamjob. She chose IT. In two days Xavier and I are planning her programm and tasks she'll do here. That's kind of a challenge. Challenge accepted. In real life, as an adult, you sometimes are confronted with such stressful situations with clients perhaps. They demand and you need to deliver. Therefore it's good to learn how to deal with these situations at a young age and get wrinkles sooner.

All those tasks mean no time for python module. Xavier and I finally created in a short amount of time, the programm for Emma. On Monday we will take her to the university. She told us that she always wanted to visit the university to see how it is. But due to covid-19 we only can take her in the morning. We will have Web Fundamentals as a subject witch Christian as our teacher. Christian will give me and Laura his feedback regarding our HTML framework, that we created and submitted as early done homework. That's good, so Emma can already see a bit about HTML, that I will show her more detailed on wednesday the same week. But to that later.

On tuesday she'll have the first day @Amanox. Rafael prepared a welcome workshop. Xavier and I will show her the building afterwards. We also will introduce her to the trainee diary, so she seas approximately where she is going to create projects and document her progress. In the following afternoon She will be learning Python with Xavier. 

The lunchbrakes will be decorated with Mariokart-Cups of course.

Wednesday will be the great dotNext webinar. We will probably have a look there. Otherwise I'll guide her through some HTML-tasks and show her CSS. Gladly on thursday we could arrange Kiru and Jim to help us out for looking out after Emma. Jim will show her some electrical magic and Kiru VM. Lastly but not least, on friday, we will be accompanied by Ruben and Armstrong to show us our datacenter. This will be exciting!
