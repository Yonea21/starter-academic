======================

I had to make sure to start with Jim's module [Hardware Basics](https://yonea-koch.netlify.app/project/hardware-basics/). From then on I was growing my trainee diary while learning the hardware basics provided by one of my coaches Jim. I began to understand how to add Posts and Projects on my Blog. I also got some first feedbakcs from Luca, who highlighted some errors, braught suggestions for improvement and send me the [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#code). I quickly realised that I could get lost in time easily trying all the different formattings. My priority was to continue the tasks in the initiated module. I got to find out what kind of components my PC at work is made of. Learning the difference between bits and bytes as well as exploring the binary number system was quite interesting. Some tutorials on YouTube accentuatet the complex production of Chips for CPUs, which i felt like it opened my range of perspective. I'm just about starting the Johnny Simulator and still figuring out what it is that I need to do. When I've figured out how to complete this task, I will continue with `Boolean algebra`. This week we would've assembled and dissembled a PC/server but we had to postpone this assignment due vacations.

Dan, our boss, showed Xavier and me the building and what places we can use in this facility. There's a super nice roof terrace for grabbing some fresh air if needed. If you want to do some activities to strenghten Team bonding, go downstairs in the cellar and play pingpong or soccer box game.
