# Slides (optional).
#   Associate this project with Markdown slides.
#   Simply enter your slide deck's filename without extension.
#   E.g. `slides = "example-slides"` references `content/slides/example-slides.md`.
#   Otherwise, set `slides = ""`.

> Get started

After you [download](https://www.python.org/downloads/) Python, search `IDLE` in your PC and create a new file.

<br>

> Syntax

`print("This is an example.")`
The highlighted above shows the syntax. The command `print` must be written in lower case. The printed as a text must be in quotes.

<br>

> Identation

Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.
Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.
Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.

Error:  
```
if 5 > 2:  
print("Five is greater than two!")
```

Correct:
```  
if 5 > 2:  
    print("Five is greater than two!")
```

<br>

> Comments

There are two ways to include comments, that won't be shown when ran.

Hashtag:
```  
#This is a comment  
print("XXX")  
```
 
or  
  
Quotes:  
```
"""
multiple
line
comment
"""
```

<br>

> Variables

You assign a value to the created variable. Otherwise Python has no command for detecting a variable.  

```
x = 5
y = "John"

print(x)
print(y)

run

5
John
```

Multiple values to multiple variables:  
```
x, y, z = "Guava", "Banana", "Papaya"

print(x)
print(y)
print(z)

run

Guava
Banana
Papaya
```

One value to multiple variables:  
```
x = y = z = "Strawberry"

print(x)
print(y)
print(z)

run

Strawberry
Strawberry
Strawberry
```

Extract values:
```
fruits = ["apple", "berry", "cherry"]
x, y, z = fruits

print(x)
print(y)
print(z)

run

apple
berry
cherry
```
<br>
> Output Variables

The Python print statement is often used to output variables.
To combine both text and a variable, Python uses the `+` character:

```
x = "awesome"
print("Python is " + x)

run

Python is awesome
```
```
x = "awesome"
print("Python is " + x + ".")

run

Python is awesome.
```

Combine variables:
```
x = "Python is "
y = "awesome."
z = x + y
print(z)

run

Python is awesome.
```

Instead of using String (texts) use Integer (numbers). Then the `omen` works as a mathematical operator. I played with some examples:
```x = 5
y = 10
print(x+y)

x = 5
y = 10
print(x*y)

x = 5
y = 10
print(x/y)

x = 5
y = 10
print(x-y)

x = 5
y = 10
print(x<y)

x = 5
y = 10
print(x>y)

x = 5
y = 10
print(x==y)

x = 5
y = 10
print(x<=y)

x = 5
y = 10
print(x>=y)

run

15
50
0.5
-5
True
False
False
True
False
```
