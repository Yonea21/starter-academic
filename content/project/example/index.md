To build your own computer, you need to be aware of following components and their functions.


Computer housing: 
  protects all the connected components – maybe even in a stylish way

Motherboard:
  Also known as Mainboard, is the main component that connects every other component with eachother

CPU (central processing unit):
  Similar to the human brain, it calculates every command made on a PC 

RAM (random access memory): 
  Mostly 8 or 16 GB enables the CPU to work faster whilst using it as a temporary storage

Hard Disk:
  SSD = solid state drive
  HHD = hard disk drive
  SSD and HHD both enable physical, long term storage

PSU (power supply unit):
  This component fuels the PC with electricity

GPU (graphics processing unit): 
  Enables 2D and 3D graphic programs to work as flawless as possible

Cooling:
  internal or external air cooling for avoiding overheated hardware



Advanced questions:
(My device is a Surface Book 2)

1.	How fast (in GHz) is the CPU you are using right now?
    i5-7300U 2.60 GHz

2.	What chipset is on the motherboard? Could there be more options?
    More options?
    Windows 10 Pro Creators Update 64 Bit

3.	How many gigabytes of RAM are in the PC you’re using?
    8.00 GB  Ram

4.	What is/are the storage medium/media in your PC?
    PCLe Solid-State-Laufwerk (SSD) 256 GB, local hard disk C:

5.	Where is the PSU in your PC? What about a laptop?
    PC trhough motherboard
    Laptop externally

6.	Do you have a GPU?
    HD-Grafik 620-GPU

7.	How does the cooling work in your device? What about a smartphone?
    My device: (Air) highly developed air conduction system inside; cooling is provided by a fan similar in design to an aircraft turbine
    Smartphone: (Heatpipe) small pipe that transmits heat to the outside




This Blog is work in progress. I will post some new stuff soon.
