To build your own computer, you need to be aware of following components and their functions.

•	Computer housing  protects all the connected components – maybe even in a stylish way
•	Motherboard  Also Mainboard, is the main component that connects every other component with eachother
•	CPU (central processing unit)  Similar to the human brain, it calculates every command made on a PC 
•	RAM (random access memory)  Mostly 8 or 16 GB enables the CPU to work faster whilst using it as a temporary storage
•	hard disk  SSD=solid state drive & HHD=hard disk drive  physical, long term storage
•	PSU (power supply unit)  the component that fuels the PC with electricity
•	GPU (graphics processing unit)  enables 2D and 
•	Cooling  internal or external air cooling
