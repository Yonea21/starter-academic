How to build an offer for a PC or a server
===========================================
If a client of yours submits an order, you submit an offer in return. This enables having an overview. The bigger or complexer an order is, the more sense it makes to even create an offer. (In IT it is often the case, that submiting an offer already is chargeable. This should be communicated clearly!)

> First you need to know what an offer usually contains. 
+ provider, date, location, validity, services/material, customer, reciver, contact person, invoice address, reference numbers, offer number
