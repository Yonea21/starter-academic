**Module Part 1**

How to build an offer for a PC or a server
===========================================
If a client of yours submits an order, you submit an offer in return. This enables having an overview. The bigger or complexer an order is, the more sense it makes to even create an offer. (In IT it is often the case, that submiting an offer already is chargeable. This should be communicated clearly!)

> First you need to know what an offer usually contains. 
+ provider, date, location, validity, services/material, customer, reciver, contact person, invoice address, reference numbers, offer number

> You then create the offer based on the requirements given by your client. 
+ Oftentimes you'll see that your clients needs not always are clear. That's where you as a provider find suitable solutions. 

> Send the offer or maybe two offers to consult your client.
+ Sometimes it is an advantage to be prepared and offer different kind of solutions to maintain flexibility.

**Module Part 2**

Working with GitHub
=====================
GitHub is a wonderful tool for creating projects. To be precise it's a software versioning tool or VCS (:= Version Control System). It also turns out to be an absolut necessity, when several programmers work on the same project. It was orginally made by Linus Torvalds, the founder of Linux. 

You can envision VCS like a graph:

![Graph 1](graph1.jpg "<b>Graph 1</b> (Module 1.5)")

Let's take the image above as an example. The green part is the masterbranch, whereas the blue and orange ones are additional branches, enabling programmers to work on their own copy of the project/code or change the content. Those changes include bugfixes, new features or updates. To realize the work, they merge the edited on to the masterbranch.

> The main rule is to never work on the master branch. Processes should always be done on a developing branch.
