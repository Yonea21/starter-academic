Yonea Koch is a 21 year old part-time student at a so called distance learning university in Bern named FFHS. Her ongoing education allows her to combine theorie with practice. The company Amanox Solutions AG is her employer and guides her through her studies. The goal is to transform her into a fully trained Cloud Engeneer.

In her freetime she enjoys practicing yoga, as well as going hiking in the lovely, swiss nature. If she finds a minute here and there she decorates her village on Animal Crossing.
